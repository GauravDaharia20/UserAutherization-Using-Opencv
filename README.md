# UserAutherization-Using-Opencv
This particular project is focused on developing a user authorization System using opencv.

In this project I have used opencv and pyzbar(Python Liberary for decoding QR/BarCode) for developing this project.

# Step Followed for Developing this system:
  1. Imported above mentioned liberaries
  2. Used face Detection using Opencv.
  3. Then used some pyzbar for decoding the QR code.
  4. After this I have small concept of DBMS check
# Hence you are good to go with Autherization System.
